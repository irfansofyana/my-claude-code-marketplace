# AI Marketplace

A skill-first repository for reusable agent workflows, packaged for multiple agent runtimes and installable from Codex via `npx skills`.

## What is This?

This repository serves as a marketplace for reusable agent workflows across agent runtimes. Claude Code packaging is still supported, but the canonical workflows live in `plugins/*/skills/*`.

## Available Plugins

| Plugin | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **[shared-mcp](./plugins/shared-mcp/)** | **INSTALL FIRST** - MCP infrastructure for web search (Brave, Tavily, Exa) | Node.js, BRAVE_API_KEY, TAVILY_API_KEY, EXA_API_KEY |
| **[p-assist](./plugins/p-assist/)** | Productivity: expenses, RSS, VPS | shared-mcp, N8N_API_TOKEN |
| **[common-engineering](./plugins/common-engineering/)** | Engineering tools: code review, Mermaid diagrams, tech docs (RFCs, proposals, ADRs), web research | shared-mcp, optional pi-9router-ext, mermaid-cli, CONTEXT7_API_KEY |
| **[sys-maint](./plugins/sys-maint/)** | System maintenance: Docker cleanup, disk analysis | macOS only |
| **[thinking-tools](./plugins/thinking-tools/)** | Thinking tools: pressure-test ideas (idea-refinery) and resolve decision branches (decision-sparring) | None |
| **[softskills](./plugins/softskills/)** | Office politics coach for navigating workplace dynamics | None |

See individual plugin READMEs for detailed setup instructions.

## Available Skills

Skills are model-invoked capabilities that agent runtimes can activate when triggered by natural language. They are organized by plugin:

### common-engineering Skills

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `code-review` | "review my code", "review this branch", "check my diff" | Structured review report with severity-classified findings |
| `mermaid` | "create a diagram", "draw architecture", "sequence diagram for..." | Validated Mermaid diagrams (sequence, architecture, flowchart) |
| `one-pager` | "write a one-pager", "create a proposal", "draft a one-pager" | 1-3 page stakeholder approval document |
| `adr` | "write an ADR", "document architecture decision", "compare X vs Y" | 1-3 page Architecture Decision Record |
| `rfc` | "write an RFC", "design proposal for cross-team review" | 5-15 page Request for Comments |
| `tsd` | "write a TSD", "document an API", "API spec" | 5-20 page Technical Specification Document |
| `poc-experiment` | "write a POC document", "Go/No-Go recommendation" | 3-8 page proof of concept with decision |
| `project-management-plan` | "project plan excel", "Gantt chart", "project tracker" | Excel workbook with 4 tabs (plan, charters, budget, RAID) |
| `web-researcher` | "search the web", "find online", "research", "look up", "debug error", "latest news about", "investigate company" | Findings with inline citations, recommendations, and source links. Routes via Brave (discovery) → Tavily (extraction) → Exa (semantic/technical) |
| `9router-web-researcher` | same broad web-research triggers as `web-researcher`; optimized for Pi users with `pi-9router-ext` | Parallel subagent research with 9router-first search/fetch, direct-tool fallback, inline citations, and research coverage. Install this or `web-researcher`, usually not both |

### thinking-tools Skills

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `idea-refinery` | "pressure-test my idea", "sparring partner", "gut-check this idea", "is this worth doing" | Concise Idea Brief with problem, MVP, risks, next actions |
| `decision-sparring` | "decision sparring", "spar with this decision", "interrogate my idea/plan", "stress-test this", "drill into this", "poke holes in it", "help me think through whether to pursue this" | Decision Summary — every branch resolved, whether viability or execution |

### softskills Skills

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `office-politics-coach` | "office politics", "navigate this situation", "difficult coworker" | Reframe, options, and word-for-word scripts for workplace dynamics |

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/irfansofyana/ai-marketplace
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add to `~/.zshrc` (macOS) or `~/.bashrc` (Linux):

```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-api-key"     # https://tavily.com
export EXA_API_KEY="your-exa-api-key"           # https://exa.ai
export N8N_API_TOKEN="your-n8n-token"           # https://n8n.io (for p-assist)
```

Reload: `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`

### 3. Install Plugins (in dependency order)

```bash
/plugin install shared-mcp@ai-marketplace     # REQUIRED - install first
/plugin install p-assist@ai-marketplace       # Optional
/plugin install common-engineering@ai-marketplace  # Optional
/plugin install sys-maint@ai-marketplace      # Optional (macOS only)
/plugin install thinking-tools@ai-marketplace # Optional
/plugin install softskills@ai-marketplace     # Optional
```

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

For local development or offline access:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irfansofyana/ai-marketplace.git
cd ai-marketplace
/plugin marketplace add $(pwd)
```

## Codex and Skills

This repo's existing `plugins/*/skills/*` structure is already discoverable by `npx skills add`. No extra wrapper layer is required for Codex.

For MCP servers, Codex does not use the Claude plugin marketplace flow. Instead, Codex reads MCP config from `~/.codex/config.toml` globally or `.codex/config.toml` per trusted project.

### Use in Codex via GitHub

If you use Codex inside ChatGPT, connect GitHub in ChatGPT Settings and authorize this repository. After that, Codex can read the repo directly from GitHub for analysis and coding tasks.

### Install for local Codex usage

Tested commands:

```bash
# Inspect available skills from the repo
npx skills add irfansofyana/ai-marketplace --list

# Install one public skill by name into the current project (default scope)
npx skills add irfansofyana/ai-marketplace --skill mermaid

# Install globally for your user environment
npx skills add irfansofyana/ai-marketplace --global --skill mermaid

# Install for Codex only without prompts
npx skills add irfansofyana/ai-marketplace --agent codex --skill mermaid --yes
```

Use exact skill names with `--skill`. Plugin names such as `common-engineering` are not valid selectors.
By default, `npx skills add` installs at project scope. Add `--global` (`-g`) when you want the skill available across projects in your user environment.
Use `--agent codex` to target Codex specifically, and `--yes` (`-y`) to skip interactive prompts.

### Install shared-mcp for Codex

The `shared-mcp` bundle is now installable for Codex through a repo-managed config template and installer script.

Global install across Codex:

```bash
bash codex/shared-mcp/install.sh --global
```

Project-scoped install for the current repo:

```bash
bash codex/shared-mcp/install.sh --project
```

This writes a managed block into Codex `config.toml` with these MCP server names:

- `shared_mcp_tavily`
- `shared_mcp_exa`
- `shared_mcp_brave_search`

Those names are intentionally namespaced for Codex so the installer does not overwrite unrelated `tavily`, `exa`, or `brave-search` entries you may already have.
The config forwards `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY`, and `BRAVE_API_KEY` from your shell at runtime instead of storing the key values in the repo.
OpenAI’s Codex MCP docs confirm that Codex MCP servers are configured either via `codex mcp` or `config.toml`, and that CLI plus IDE share the same config: https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp

Per-skill path installs should target:

```text
plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>
```

Important note: a whole-repo install or discovery will also surface personal/private skills such as `analyze-cc-statements` from `p-assist`. Treat `p-assist` as personal/private and do not market it as part of the public Codex-ready path.

## Using with Other AI Agents (via OPKG)

This marketplace works with [OpenPackage (OPKG)](https://openpackage.dev) for 30+ AI platforms (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, OpenCode, etc.).

OPKG maps the universal structure to your platform's format:

| Universal | Claude Code | Cursor | OpenCode |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| `commands/` | `.claude/commands/` | `.cursor/commands/` | `.opencode/commands/` |
| `agents/` | `.claude/agents/` | `.cursor/agents/` | `.opencode/agents/` |
| `skills/` | `.claude/skills/` | `.cursor/skills/` | `.opencode/skills/` |

└── .mcp.json                # Optional: MCP server config
```

**1. Create `plugin.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "What it does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": { "name": "irfansofyana" }
}
```

**2. Register in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": "./plugins/my-plugin",
  "description": "Brief description"
}
```

**3. Test:**
```bash
/plugin uninstall my-plugin@ai-marketplace
/plugin install my-plugin@ai-marketplace
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| API key not found | Add to shell config, reload (`source ~/.zshrc`), restart Claude Code |
| MCP server not responding | Check Node.js (`node --version`), verify API keys |
| Plugin install failed | Ensure marketplace added first, install shared-mcp first |
